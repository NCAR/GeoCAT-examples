# GeoCAT-examples

GeoCAT-examples repo contains visualization examples that demonstrate how to use GeoCATâ€™s computational functions 
or how to plot data with packages in the Python ecosystem (primarily, Matplotlib and Cartopy).

Check out our [GeoCAT-Examples Gallery](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see the example plots 
and to access Python code files as well as auto-generated Jupyter notebooks of this repo!

Several visualizations in this repository could be compared to NCL scripts from the 
[NCL Application Examples website](https://ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/).
