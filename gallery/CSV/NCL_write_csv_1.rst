NCL_write_csv_1.py
===================
This script illustrates the following concepts:
   - Using python tools 'csv' and 'pandas' to write integers to a CSV file

See following URLs to see the reproduced NCL plot & script:
    - Original NCL script: https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/Scripts/write_csv_1.ncl

Expected format for output csv files is:
    
    34,67,56
    
    36,87,78
    
    31,56,88
