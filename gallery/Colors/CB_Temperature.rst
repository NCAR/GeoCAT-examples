CB_Temperature.py
=================

This script illustrates multiple color schemes for color maps which will allow for those
impacted by color blindness to see visualizations. Using rainbow color schemes is also
a poor choice in color scheme for images that may be transferred to a black and white 
scale for printing. This code addresses a handful of options to use in place of rainbow 
color schemes for use in the matplotlib.pyplot library.

Figure 1. 
   - The rainbow color scheme is problematic due to the lack of a natural perceived ordering of colors,
     perceptual changes in the colors (ex: yellow and green blend together easily), and is sensitive to 
     deficiencies in vision

Figure 2. 
   - The coolwarm diverging scheme should be used when both high and low values are interesting. 
     However, be careful using this scheme if the projection will be printed to black and white. 

Figure 3. 
  - This is an example of a less distinct contrasting color gradient. This choice in color scheme would 
    be a good choice for printing in black and white but may create some challenges for individuals who 
    experience blue-green colorblindness. 

Figure 4.
 - This plot shows how drastically contrasting colors can be incredibly useful for plotting this type of data.
   This color scheme will work well for color blind impacted individuals and is black and white print friendly.
